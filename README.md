By treating each AS as a node, and the connection between neighboring ASes as a link/edge, we can represent the Internet as a graph (an AS-level graph that captures the connectivity between ASes). 
I've derived the AS-level graph from the BGP routing table.

By downloading the files you can see how the program displays the graphs.
